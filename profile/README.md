# BYUI Formula Hybrid Team Organization – GitHub Defaults Repository 

Welcome to the **organization-wide `.github` repository** for the BYUI Formula Hybrid Team!  

This repository contains default files and templates that are used across all repositories in our organization to standardize workflows, contributions, and communication.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This `.github` repository is intended to provide:

- **Issue Templates** – Pre-defined templates for Stories, Features, Bugs, Tasks, and RFCs.  
- **Contribution Guidelines** – A `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide team members and external contributors.  
- **Code of Conduct** – A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to set expectations for behavior and inclusivity.  
- **Support Information** – A `SUPPORT.md` pointing users to Discord and other support channels.  
- **Governance** – A `GOVERNANCE.md` outlining team structure, roles, permissions, and decision-making.  

> These files are automatically available to all repositories in the organization unless a repository provides its own overrides.

## How to Use These Files

- **Issue Templates:** When creating a new issue in any repository, GitHub will prompt you to select a template from `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Use these templates to report bugs, propose features, or submit stories.  
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` when making code contributions, submitting pull requests, or proposing changes.  
- **Code of Conduct:** All team members and contributors must follow the guidelines in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.  
- **Support:** Refer to `SUPPORT.md` for help, including our Discord server and other contact channels.
