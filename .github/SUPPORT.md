# Support

Thank you for using the BYUI Formula Hybrid Team Organization projects!  
If you need help, guidance, or have questions, there are several ways to get support.

## 1. Join Our Discord Server

Our primary support channel is our **official Discord server**.  
Here you can:

- Ask questions about the projects
- Report issues or bugs informally
- Discuss ideas and features
- Get help from team members in real time

**Join here:** [Insert Discord Invite Link]  

**Tips for Discord Support:**

- Use relevant channels (e.g., `#general`, `#help`, `#development`) for your questions.
- Be clear and concise when describing your problem.
- Include screenshots or code snippets if applicable.
- Respect others’ time and contributions.

## 2. GitHub Issues

If you find a bug, want to propose a feature, or submit a story:

- Open a new issue using one of our **Issue Templates** (`Bug`, `Feature`, `Story`, etc.).
- Make sure your issue is descriptive and includes all required information.
- This is the best way to track problems formally.

## 3. Email / Other Contact

If Discord or GitHub isn’t suitable, you can contact the organization leadership via email:  

**Email:** [Insert Contact Email]  

Please include as much detail as possible in your message so we can help efficiently.
