# BYUI Formula Hybrid Team Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **BYUI Formula Hybrid Team**!  

We are a multidisciplinary team of students and engineers working on the BYUI Formula Hybrid car project, combining **mechanical, electrical, and software expertise** to design, build, and compete in hybrid vehicle competitions.

## Our Mission

To innovate and excel in hybrid vehicle engineering by fostering collaboration, learning, and hands-on experience for all team members.

## Organization Structure

The Engineering Team is divided into three sub-teams:

| Sub-Team       | Focus Area                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Mechanical     | Design, manufacturing, and testing of mechanical systems |
| Electrical     | Electronics design, wiring, and power systems        |
| Software       | Software development, firmware, and control systems |

Each sub-team operates semi-autonomously but collaborates closely on integration and project-wide initiatives.
