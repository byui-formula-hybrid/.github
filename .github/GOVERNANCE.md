# Governance for BYUI Formula Hybrid Team Organization

This document outlines the governance structure, roles, and responsibilities for the BYUI Formula Hybrid Team Organization. It ensures clarity in decision-making, access control, and collaboration across the organization.

---

## 1. Organization Structure

The **Engineering Team** is composed of three sub-teams:

| Sub-Team       | Responsibilities                                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mechanical     | Design, manufacturing, and testing of mechanical systems |
| Software       | Software development, firmware, and control systems      |
| Electrical     | Electronics design, wiring, and power systems            |

Each sub-team operates semi-autonomously but collaborates closely on cross-team initiatives.

---

## 2. Team Roles

Each sub-team has the following roles:

### Team Lead
- Oversees team operations and priorities
- Approves contributions and changes within the team
- Acts as the primary liaison with other sub-teams

### Core Members
- Full contributors to team projects
- Can create, review, and merge changes within team repositories or directories
- Participate in design reviews and planning meetings

### Contributors
- External or rotating members
- Can propose changes, report issues, and participate in discussions
- Require approval from Core Members or Team Leads to merge contributions

---

## 3. Repository and Access Permissions

- Each sub-team has **dedicated repositories or folders** with appropriate access controls.
- Permissions:

| Team           | Access Level                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Mechanical     | Read/Write within mechanical repos  |
| Software       | Read/Write within software repos    |
| Electrical     | Read/Write within electrical repos  |
| Other Members  | Read-Only access unless approved    |

- Cross-team contributions must follow the standard **pull request process** and be reviewed by the relevant sub-team lead.

---

## 4. Decision-Making

- **Routine decisions** (day-to-day work, small fixes) are made within each sub-team.
- **Cross-team decisions** (major design changes, integration plans) require:
  - Consensus from all three sub-team leads, or
  - Escalation to the **Engineering Team Lead** if consensus cannot be reached
- **Organization-wide decisions** (budget, membership, policies) are made by the **Organization Leadership Team**.

---

## 5. Communication Guidelines

- Use designated channels on **Discord** for each sub-team.
- Cross-team discussions happen in the `#engineering` or relevant channels.
- Major proposals or RFCs should be documented in GitHub and discussed asynchronously if needed.

---

## 6. Onboarding and Membership

- New members are assigned to a sub-team based on skills and interests.
- Team Leads approve access permissions and repository assignments.
- All members are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## 7. Updates to Governance

- Changes to governance must be approved by the **Organization Leadership Team**.
- Updates should be documented in this file and communicated to all teams.
